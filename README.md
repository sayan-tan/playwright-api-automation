## üìñ Introduction
This repository contains a Test Automation Framework built using Playwright and Javascript for automated testing of REST APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.16.1 or higher recommended)
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-CB3837?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v9.5.1 or higher recommended)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayan-tan/playwright-api-automation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd playwright-api-automation-framework
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## üöÄ Running Tests

  ```bash
  npm run playwright:tests
  ```

## üìÅ Project Structure

The tests follow a modular and maintainable structure:

```
|-- .github
|     |-- workflows
|          |-- 01_api_tests.yml
|          |-- 02_api_tests_select_env.yml
|-- test-data
|     |-- login
|          |-- login-successful.json
|          |-- login-unsuccessful.json
|     |-- register
|          |-- register-successful.json
|          |-- register-unsuccessful.json
|     |-- users
|          |-- user_create.json
|          |-- user_update_patch.json
|          |-- user_update_put.json
|-- tests-reqres
|     |-- login.spec.js
|     |-- register.spec.js
|     |-- users.spec.js
|-- utils
|     |-- EndpointUtils.js
|     |-- RequestBodyUtils.js
|     |-- RequestUtils.js
|     |-- ResponseUtils.js
|     |-- VerificationUtils.js
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- playwright.config.js
```

- `playwright-report`: Contains the HTML report for tests (Logs are attached).
- `test-data`: Contains external files (example: user create/update data) that can be used to mock data during tests.
- `tests-reqres`: Contains the actual test files. You can organize your tests into subdirectories as needed. 
- `utils`: Contains the Utilities that provide methods for asserting different conditions on web elements, handling requests, and responses.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Modify `playwright.config.js` for playwright configuration settings such as
  - `baseURL`
  - `testDir`
  - `reporter`

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

This project is configured for CI using GitHub Actions. Check the configurations in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

- `01_api_tests.yml`: This workflow executes tests in a pre-defined environment PROD.
- `02_api_tests_select_env.yml`: This workflow will first ask the User to select the environment (DEV / Pre-PROD / PROD) for test execution.

## üìä Reporting

The Playwright HTML report (Logs are attached) is stored in the `playwright-report` directory.
